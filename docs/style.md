In order to make the final result of my assignment resonate more with the
assessors (and because I suck at design ), I took a look at the source of
https://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/ to see which colors, fonts and other style elements
were used to convey the company's corporate identity.

- The corporate logo is:

  ![Takeaway logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Takeaway_com.png)
- The font used is:

  [![Open Sans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onassar/GoogleWebFonts-FontFamilyPreviewImages/master/48px/original/OpenSans-400.v15.png)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans)
- The color scheme used is:
  - ![#FF8000](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/FF8000/FFF.png&text=FF8000) for highlights
  - ![#50aecc](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/50aecc/FFF.png&text=50aecc) for user actions
  - ![#F9F5F1](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/f9f5f1/000.png&text=F9F5F1) for background
  - ![#333333](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/333333/FFF.png&text=333333) for regular text
  - ![#FFFFFF](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/ffffff/000.png&text=FFFFFF) for section backgrounds
  - ![#261E1E](https://dummyimage.com/microbar/261E1E/FFF.png&text=261E1E) for contrast sections backgrounds (or semi-transparant: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75)`)

These colors and font will be used as a basis for my sample applications.

The Takeaway logo is used as basis for the branding of my sample application.
