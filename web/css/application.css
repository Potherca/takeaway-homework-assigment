/********( CSS Introduction )**************************************************/
/*
    This file contains all of the CSS needed to style the sample application
    that is part of the Takeaway Homework Assignment.

    In a production environment the files imported from here would most likely
    be concattenated together (and/or minified).

    The custom CSS has been split into three separate parts:

     - Layout - The size, location and positioning of elements on the page
     - Design - The color, style and look of elements on the page
     - Modules - A combination of Layout and Design for sub-element

    The main reason for this separation is that is makes it trivial to change
    the "theme" of a page without having to think about layout and positioning
    and vice-versa. In a production code-base the modules would most likely be
    split across several separate files but for this sassignment that felt like
    overkill.
