# Takeaway Homework Assignment

## Introduction

This document outlines the process I went through whilst implementing the
"homework" assignment I received from Takeaway.

## Step taken

1. Dowload, unzip and read the assignment (see [my critique](./docs/critique.md))
2. Research Takeaway corporate identity (see [style](./docs/style.md))
3. Build the main UI overview
4. Build a UI component to represent a restaurant.

## Notes

- I have chosen to use the [<img src="https://bulma.io/images/bulma-logo.png" alt="Bulma" width="80" height="20" />](https://bulma.io)
  CSS framework to quickly have something decent-looking setup.
